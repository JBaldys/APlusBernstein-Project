# Alliance Bernstein Factor Timing Project
Our team’s overarching goal of this project would be to identify a unique, comprehensive, and actionable trading strategy that will meet the following standards: 1.) outperforms a passive S&P 500 strategy, 2.) incorporates a variety of different underlying signals/financial data, most notably sentiment and volatility-based signals, 3.) presents a tangible competitive value, and 4.) represents the nature of future research that we believe Alliance Bernstein can conduct beyond the scope of this individual project.

# Tentative Timeline / Important Dates
-	3/14-3/19: EDA, feature engineering
-	3/18: In-person visit with Che from Alliance Bernstein, 2-3 pm (prioritize making this meeting!)
-	3/20-3/26: EDA cont., begin modeling
-	3/27-4/2: modeling, beginning of model revision / novel signal creation (all group members should have already been doing research into novel signal creation up until this point)
-	4/3-4/16: “flex time”, issues during this time will be dependent on what group members feel their bandwidth looks like at this point
-	4/17-4/30: presentation creation and paper writing

# Meetings

- Will meet 2x a week - Thursday @4:30pm and Sunday @10:30am
- Thursday meetings serve as mid-point check-ins for issues
- All pull requests / code reviews should be entered by the Saturday prior to Sunday meetings
- All issues should be closed on the Sunday they are due


# Repo Structure 

The repo is structured as follows: Notebooks are grouped according to their series (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc) which reflects the general task to be performed in those notebooks.  Start with the *0 notebook in the series and add other investigations relevant to the task in the series (e.g., `11-cleaned-scraped.ipynb`).  If your notebook is extremely long, make sure you've utilized nbdev reuse capabilities and consider whether you can divide the notebook into two notebooks.

All files which appear in the repo should be able to run, and not contain error or blank cell lines, even if they are relatively midway in development of the proposed task. All notebooks relating to the analysis should have a numerical prefix (e.g., 31-) followed by the exploration (e.g. 31-text-labeling). Any utility notebooks should not be numbered, but be named according to their purpose. All notebooks should have lowercase and hyphenated titles (e.g., 10-process-data not 10-Process-Data). All notebooks should adhere to literate programming practices (i.e., markdown writing to describe problems, assumptions, conclusions) and provide adequate although not superfluous code comments.
